                    <p>I am a front end developer currently working at Vitamix. I have been a web developer for 3 years, previously working at Budget Dumpster where I grew my strengths in advanced CSS, CMS development, custom design systems and accessibility. I love sharing my passion for coding through teaching and mentoring--especially other women. I volunteer regularly with Tech Elevator and the Center for Arts Inspired Learning, leading workshops for budding developers of all ages and experience levels.</p>
